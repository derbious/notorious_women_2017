> a reputation as Japan's most popular maiko and finally became a geiko on her 21st birthday.

![Kyoto](images/kyoto.jpg)
> Gion
> Knowledgeable insiders estimate that there are about 100 geiko and 100 maiko in Kyoto. Other cities, like Tokyo,
> have some version of geisha, but they don’t usually undergo the strict training that defines Kyoto’s maiko and geiko

## Geisha of Kyoto
* Their skills include performing various arts such as classical music, dance, games, and conversation, traditionally to entertain male customers, but also female customers today.
* Iwasaki was the most famous geiko in Japan until her sudden publicized retirement at the age of 29.

> They are NOT prostitutes, despite various silly rumors and portrayals in certain books and movies.
> Rather, they are ladies who have trained for years in the traditional Japanese arts to become
> the perfect entertainers.

## Notorious Mineko
* Sued American author _Arthur Golden_
* Iwasaki later regretted interviewing for Golden, having cited a breach of confidentiality and later sued and settled out of court with Golden for the parallelism between his book and her life.
* he later released her own autobiography titled _Geisha of Gion_ in 2002.


## Legendary
* Retired a height of career
* Moved to reform education
* Became artist

> After the death of one of her most significant mentors in 1980, Iwasaki became increasingly 
> frustrated with the tradition-bound world of the geiko, especially inadequacies in the
> education system. Iwasaki unexpectedly retired at the height of her career, at the age
> of 29. She hoped that her decision would shock Gion into reform; however, even after
> over 70 other high ranking geiko emulated her retirement, nothing was changed. In her
> autobiography, Iwasaki speculates that she may have inadvertently doomed the profession.
> She transitioned to a career in art after she married an artist named Jin'ichirō Satō
> in 1982. Their only child, Kosuke, was born in 1983.

> a junior high school student who was two years older than her. It was this roommate who
> told Sadako about the Japanese legend which promises that anyone who folds one thousand
> origami cranes will be granted a wish, and taught her how to fold the origami cranes.
> Although she had plenty of free time during her days in the hospital, Sadako lacked paper.
> She would use medicine wrappings and whatever else she could scrounge; this included
> going to other patients' rooms to ask to use the paper from their get-well presents.>


## 1000?
* Comes from the book _Sadako and the Thousand Paper Cranes_
* Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum
> It is believed that she only folded 644, but father confirmed that she completed 1000,
> and was buried with them.
> The crane in Japan is one of the mystical or holy creatures (others include the dragon
> and the tortoise) and is said to live for a thousand years: That is why 1000 cranes are
> made, one for each year. In some stories it is believed that the 1000 cranes must be
> completed within one year and they must all be made by the person who is to make the wish
> at the end.
